    <p>In this game, the player will roll two dice, and the computer will roll two dice. Whoever has the higher sum wins the round!</p>
    <p>Each round, you and the computer will bet. If either player ever can't bet because their wallet is empty, the game ends.</p>
    <p>You are allowed to wager nothing if you are betting. The computer will call your bet, raise the bet, or fold.</p>
    <p>Then the sums of the dice rolls are shown, and the pot goes to the winner!</p>
    <p>If any rolls are a tie, no points are awarded, and the wager carries into next round. You can quit at any time by clicking "cancel".</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
